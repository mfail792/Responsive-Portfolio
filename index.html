            <p>Hello! My name is Matt Faile and I am an apprentice coder at the UMN Boot Camp. In my spare time I like
                to go for walks, go to the beach, ride bikes, play computer games or play with my daughter. I am
                currently learning to code to enhance my skills so that I may one day become a web developer and
                eventually a full stack engineer. I have even thought about opening up my own business down
                the road!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I like to explore. I just recently I took my daughter to a Minnesota State Park in
                Afton. She likes to run it out on the trails. We also saw a deer out in the wild! By the end of the day,
                we
                were all very tired. This is the conclusion of my story and about me section.
            </P>
